What's the role about?

As a Backend Engineer you will work in a long-lived dedicated team/squad alongside contributors of all disciplines (Design, Mobile, Product, Scientists, QA). You and your team will be responsible for an overall company goal and will work together at defining the roadmap that will lead to the most impact.

Currently, Backend Engineers are working in teams like Conversation, Growth, Platform, Predictions and Maps to quote only non-internal team names 🙂

Our stack

The Zenly backend is written mostly in Go with a bit of Rust. We have monorepos for both that host standalone services. Communication from and between services is done using gRPC or GraphQL depending on usecases.

The number of technologies we use is fairly limited as we aim to master the inner workings of what we use in production. Our main database is ScyllaDB (C++ drop-in Cassandra alternative), our real time bus is powered by NATS and our durable event bus is built on top of Kafka. 3 pieces of software that we learned (the hard way) to use properly at scale.

Finally, everything runs in GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) and supports 100s of thousands of QPS on less than a 1000 cores. Don't hesitate to look at the SRE job opening for additional information on the infra stack.

PS: The client software that communicates with the server is also written in Go and shares a lot with the backend 😃

🔑What you'll do as a Backend Engineer:
Work as part of a long-lived team, helps define and reach objectives that have an impact on the trajectory of Zenly.
Participate in the elaboration and delivery of your team's roadmap and ship features that instantly reach millions of users.
Work hand-to-hand with fellow SREs to design scalable architectures for the features you want to build.
Write technical specifications and submit their design for review and discussion.
Build monitoring dashboards to understand how things are doing in production.
Deploy multiple times a day.
What type of experience matters for the job:
Building user-facing features
Deep knowledge of Rust
Exposure to architectural patterns of high-traffic environments
An appetence for distributed-systems and related problematics
Conducting performance issues analysis (and resolving them 😅)
🧐What to expect:
Have direct impact, in days, on the company growth
Be part of a company with ethics, work alongside smart people
Build a product that brings people closer to their friends and family"

What's the role about?

As an Android Engineer you will work in a long-lived dedicated team/squad alongside contributors of all disciplines (Backend, Design, iOS, Product, Scientists, QA). You and your team will be responsible for an overall company goal and will work together at defining the roadmap that will lead to the most impact.

Currently, Android Engineers are working in teams like Conversation, Growth, App Platform and Maps to quote only non-internal team names 🙂

Our App

Zenly is written mainly in Kotlin with remains of Java but also quite uniquely in Go (we embed a shared library written in Go that deals with stuff like data synchronization, Network transport and cross-os app feature backends like the Chat or the Location pipeline). Our min SDK is 21 😁

We make extensive usage of RxJava in structural parts of the app like (lifecycle bound tasks, scheduling, multi-threading, reactive UI model, automated tracing) and have a fair number of internal frameworks built on top of it.

Last but not least, we try to push Zenly to the edge of the devices capabilities and had much fun making non traditional heavy UI experiences and animations on Android, sometimes heavily tweaking or going beyond what the system normally provides.

What you'll do as an Android Engineer:
Participate in the elaboration and delivery of your team's roadmap.
Work closely with our product and design peers to craft the best experience possible for the Android platform.
Use Zenly UI/UX principles to build industry leading standards (smooth transitions, one-handed interactions)
Deliver well-architected products with high bar for UX craft and engineering high quality
Ensure that what we build works seamlessly on multiple Android devices and in low connectivity areas
What type of experience matters for the job:
Building Android apps in Kotlin/Java + std libs with strong knowledge of the Android SDK.
Crafting elaborate UI interactions
Solving UI performance issues
Dealing with somewhat complex multithreading problems
Digging in large code bases including Android AOSP and API design
Extensible software design (plugins architecture, API design, DDD)
